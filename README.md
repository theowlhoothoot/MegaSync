# MegaSync
Syncs a mega folder with a local folder, no account required. 

In this project are the original notebook file, the compiled .py, and the distribution .exe that is created from pyinstaller with a config file.


For those who want to build them themselves into an .exe you can do so using pyinstaller with the following command and referenced modules installed.

pyinstaller --onefile megasync.py
